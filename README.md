# Introduction to iOS App Development in Swift

## Course Description

This course covers mobile application development in iOS using Swift. We will learn how to build a simple application using iOS tools including AutoLayout, UIKit, Views, TableViews, ViewControllers and more. We will study how MVC architecture is implemented in iOS and how information is passed between ViewControllers using both Segues and manual navigation.

## Prerequisites:

[MOB 1.1](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.1-Introduction-to-Swift)

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

1. Build an app using UIKit basic components including: UIViews, UIViewControllers, UITableViews, UICollectionViews and custom cells.
1.  Apply AutoLayout & Size Classes to achieve a good distribution of elements in different screen sizes and orientations.
1. Implement MVC in a basic iOS app, understanding the separation of concerns for each component.
1. Pass information between view controllers using segues and also using the manual approach.
1. Apply different techniques to find and solve bugs within Xcode.

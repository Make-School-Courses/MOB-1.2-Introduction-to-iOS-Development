# Introduction to iOS App Development in Swift

## Course Description

This course covers mobile application development in iOS using Swift. We will learn how to build a simple application using iOS tools including AutoLayout, UIKit, Views, TableViews, ViewControllers and more. We will study how MVC architecture is implemented in iOS and how information is passed between ViewControllers using both Segues and manual navigation.

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.

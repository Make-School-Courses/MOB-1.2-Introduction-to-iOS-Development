# Introduction to iOS App Development in Swift

## Course Description

This course covers mobile application development in iOS using Swift. We will learn how to build a simple application using iOS tools including AutoLayout, UIKit, Views, TableViews, ViewControllers and more. We will study how MVC architecture is implemented in iOS and how information is passed between ViewControllers using both Segues and manual navigation.

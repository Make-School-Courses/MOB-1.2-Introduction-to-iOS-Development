## Agenda

- Learning Objectives
- Review
- Layout Guides & Safe Area
- Scroll Views

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

1. **Differentiate** between the frame and bounds of a view.
1. **Identify** various layout guide lines in a screen.
1. **Implement** a scroll view using the interface builder.

<!-- > -->

## Review/Warm Up (5 min)

Pair up to discuss the following:
  - Why do we need AutoLayout? What problems does it solve.
  - Can we layout views without using AutoLayout?
  - The 4 Properties of AutoLayout.
  - The most common issue you had while working with constraints.

Post your answers in our slack channel for participation ðŸ¤“

## Frame vs Bounds

Before we continue, it's important to know the difference between the frame and the bounds of a view.

This concept might come up during an interview and we should be able to tell the difference.

**8 min** read [this article](https://medium.com/@suragch/frame-vs-bounds-in-ios-107990ad53ee)

**5 min** Then go to [Gradescope](www.gradescope.com) to submit answers to 3 questions from the article.

## Layout Guides & Safe Area

Layout guides define rectangular regions that donâ€™t actually appear visibly onscreen, but help with the positioning, alignment, and spacing of content.

### Margins

We use margins to position views so that they are not crowded by other content.

![margin](assets/margin.png)

<aside class = "notes">
The layout margins consist of inset values for each edge (top, bottom, leading, and trailing) of the view. These inset values create a space between the edges of the viewâ€™s bounds rectangle and the content inside the view.

Layout margins provide a space between a viewâ€™s content and any content outside of the viewâ€™s bounds.
</aside>

<!-- v -->

### Safe Area

![safearea](assets/safearea.png)

<aside class="notes">
We use it to position views so that they are not obstructed by other content.


Adhere to the safe area and layout margins defined by UIKit. The safe area also prevents content from underlapping the status bar, navigation bar, toolbar, and tab bar.

## Scroll Views

Sometimes content won't fit in the available space. This is particularly harder to achieve given iPhones have different screen sizes. Here's where the need for content that scroll originates.

The class in iOS that creates them is called `ScrollView`.

Setting a scroll view can be quite a headache, because there are guidelines, safe areas and content sizes we need to pay attention to.

## Scrollview recipe

1. Add a **UIScrollView** to the screen and pin the top, bottom, trailing and leading edges to the **Safe Area**.
1. An easy way to set the content is using a **stack view**. You would pin the the the stack's top, bottom, trailing and leading edges to the **Content Layout Guide**.
1. Set the **content view**'s width to match the **Frame Layout Guide**'s width.
1. Look for missing constraints inside the **content view**.
1. If all is correct, the scroll view will set its content size automatically ðŸ¤© based on the components inside the content view.

## Activity

35 min - Replicate the following layout.<br>

![scroll](assets/scroll.gif)

<!-- v -->

![hierarchy](assets/viewHierarchy.png)

<!-- v -->

<aside class="notes">
You can change the size of the screen you see in the interface builder to be as long as you need to see the elements you are adding to the scroll view. And not having to be restricted to the real screen size.

do this by selecting the view controller with the scroll view, then go to the attributes inspector and choose the ruler icon. Change the simulated size from Fixed to Freeform and make it as large as you need.
</aside>

If you get stuck ask for help first ðŸ˜€

Then you can compare your implementation with [this solution](https://github.com/amelinagzz/scrollview-demo)

You now have a working scrollview. ðŸŽ‰

It works great to show content to your user, in this case, **regardless of the height of their screen**.

<!-- > -->

Sometimes we'll need to make our apps react according to what a user does with the scrollview.

<!-- > -->

For example: Animating views or resizing objects as they scroll.

![airbnb](assets/airbnb.gif)

<!-- v -->

Detecting when they reach specific content to reveal a button.

![store](assets/store.gif)

<!-- v -->

All of these are **events** we can track from the scrollview.

UIKit has made it really easy for us to work with all of these events. We just need to tell our program that we want access to these helper methods. To do that, we set up something called a **delegate**.

<!-- v -->

## How to

1. Create an outlet for the scrollview in your current View Controller.
2. Add `UIScrollViewDelegate` to the end of the class declaration (as you would add any other protocol)

```swift
class ScrollExampleVC: UIViewController, UIScrollViewDelegate { ...
```

3. In `viewDidLoad` set the delegate of the scrollview: `scrollView.delegate = self`
4. Add this new method to the class and run the app to see the console log.

```swift
func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) {
  print("I'm scrolling ðŸ˜Ž")
}
```

<!-- v -->

5. Read [this article](https://medium.com/swift-india/a-little-story-about-uiscrollview-in-ios-d2fd50091367) and look up what `contentOffset` and `contentSize` are. Can you figure out a way to print out the message "You've reached the end" when you scroll to the bottom of the content?

6. At the end of the same article you used above, you can find more methods available, experiment with them while you think how you could find them useful in your projects.

## After Class/Lab

<!--Install [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) in a project.

For this activity you will need to have [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org). If you are not familiar with it. Go to their site to read about what it is and follow the instructions to install it.
-->

1. Submit today's ScrollView activity to Gradescope.

2. Finish the [Tip Calculator Tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/online-courses/tutorials/build-a-tip-calculator-in-swift-4/intro-tip-calculator)

## Size Classes - Extra topic (optional)

Are traits that are automatically assigned to content areas based on their size.

The system defines two size classes:
 - **regular** - denotes a bigger space
 - **compact** -  denotes constrained space

<!-- > -->

A view may possess any combination of size classes:

![sizeclass](assets/sizeclass.png)

- Regular width, regular height
- Compact width, compact height
- Regular width, compact height
- Compact width, regular height

<!-- > -->

Full list of combinations [here](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/)

<!-- > -->

## Using Size Classes

- Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.2-Introduction-to-iOS-Development/blob/master/Lessons/02-AutoLayout/assignments/sizeclasses.md) to create a layout that works in portrait and landscape orientations.
- If you get stuck feel free to debug with a partner or raise your hand to ask questions.

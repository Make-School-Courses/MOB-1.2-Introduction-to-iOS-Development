## The Subscription Box - Onboarding Flow

You are going to create an onboarding flow for a subscription box app. The box contents are up to you. Get creative! ðŸ˜¯

### What is an onboarding flow?

Is how we introduce users to an app, a service, product or feature.

It's purpose is to get usersready to fulfill a specific action: make a purchase, create an account, use a feature, etc.

All onboarding flows rely heavily in a great design and key information being displayed, engaging the user in the process.

### Requirements

- Create 3 screens for the onboarding flow.
- Each screen must have an image and some text about the app.
- Make all of the UI programmatically. Don't use the interface builder this time.

##### Resources & Suggestions

Use free Illustrations
- [unDraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations)
- [drawKit](https://www.drawkit.io)

Use a `ScrollView` to scroll horizontally between the views.

Use a `UIPageControl` to make the indicator at the bottom.

## Size Classes

Are traits that are automatically assigned to content areas based on their size.

The system defines two size classes:
 - **regular** - denotes a bigger space
 - **compact** -  denotes constrained space

A view may possess any combination of size classes:

<aside class = "notes">

- Regular width, regular height
- Compact width, compact height
- Regular width, compact height
- Compact width, regular height

## Using Size Classes

- Follow the instructions [here](assignments/sizeclasses.md) to create a layout that works in portrait and landscape orientations.
- If you get stuck feel free to debug with a partner or raise your hand to ask questions.

<!-- v -->

Why do you think we needed to change our initial setup and add more stack views?

<!-- v -->

Why do we care to change the layout in landscape mode, when the original stack view changed by itself and we could still see the 4 colors?

<!-- v -->

Is it always required to use size classes? What is a good criteria to know if we should use them or not?

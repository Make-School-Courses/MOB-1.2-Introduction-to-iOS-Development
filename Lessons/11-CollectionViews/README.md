# UICollectionViews

## Creating Models

- We've worked all the way until now using dummy data. Now is time to use Models to represent the objects in our app. Remember MVC and where these files need to live.

Here is a basic example, tailor it to your own app:

```swift
struct Item{
    let name: String
    let image: String
}

struct Box{
    let date: String
    let items: [Item]
}

struct Category{
    let name: String
}

struct User{

}
```

Create the models for you app.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

- Implement UICollectionViews in code
- Handle UICollectionView's datasource and delegate
- Manage update animations

<!-- > -->

## UICollectionView

**An object that manages an ordered collection of data items and presents them using customizable layouts.**

We find them in many Apple apps used to display a collection of items.

Instagram/Pinterest - Items are Photos<br>
Spotify - Items are genres, artists or songs

## Layout

Layout in a collection view is everything that deals with *where* the content is displayed.<br>
Each individual item is specified by the UICollectionView's layout attributes (bounds, center, frame...). These properties are used to define the **items** in the collection view.

`UICollectionViewLayout` is a class that is meant to be subclassed, to let you customize it.

But just in case, there is one already called **UICollectionViewFlowLayout** that you can use right away.

## Line based design

Line based layout systems can adapts to many designs.

**Vertical Scrolling**<br>
Here we see what happens when the flow layout lays out the items in the collection view.

**Line Spacing**

**Inter item spacing**

**Horizontal Scrolling**<br>
Here we see what happens when the flow layout lays out the items in the collection view.<br>

## Data Source

Deals with what goes as the content of the `UICollectionView`.

```
func numberOfSections(in collectionView: UICollectionView) -> Int
func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -> Int
func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell

```

<!-- > -->

## Delegate

Handles user interaction with items in the collection view: highlighting, selecting, dragging, etc.

```swift
func collectionView(UICollectionView, shouldSelectItemAt: IndexPath) -> Bool
func collectionView(UICollectionView, didSelectItemAt: IndexPath)
func collectionView(UICollectionView, shouldDeselectItemAt: IndexPath) -> Bool
func collectionView(UICollectionView, didDeselectItemAt: IndexPath)

```

<!-- > -->

## Setup

1. Instantiate a `UICollectionView` object in a view controller

```swift
var collectionView : UICollectionView!
var emojis: [String] = Array(repeating: "ðŸ˜Ž", count: 100)
...
collectionView = UICollectionView(frame: view.bounds, collectionViewLayout: UICollectionViewFlowLayout())
```

<!-- > -->

2. Set dataSource and delegate of the collection view

```swift
collectionView.dataSource = self
collectionView.delegate = self
```

<!-- > -->

3. Create a cell and layout the contents inside

```swift
//Example with xib file

class CustomCell: UICollectionViewCell {
    static var identifier: String = "CustomCell"

    @IBOutlet weak var label: UILabel!

    override func awakeFromNib() {
        super.awakeFromNib()
        backgroundColor = UIColor.lightGray
        layer.cornerRadius = 5
        layer.masksToBounds = true
    }
}
```

<!-- > -->

4. Register cell & reuse identifier

```swift
collectionView.register(CustomCell.self, forCellWithReuseIdentifier: CustomCell.identifier)
```

<!-- > -->

5. Implement methods needed from data source and delegate.

```swift
func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
       return emojis.count
   }

func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
       let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: CustomCell.identifier, for: indexPath as IndexPath) as! CustomCell
       cell.label.text = self.emojis[indexPath.item]
       return cell
}

func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didSelectItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
       print("You selected item in row \(indexPath.row)")
}
```

## In Class activity

[Activity in pairs](assignments/assignment.md)

## Using performBatchUpdates

A common situation when a collection view needs to update the arrangement of its items. Deleting, adding and moving items can be done using animations instead of calling `reloadData()` this will result in a better user experience.

<!-- > -->

We can use the performBatchUpdates method to trigger several updates on the collectionView at the same time.

```
func performBatchUpdates(_ updates: (() -> Void)?, completion: ((Bool) -> Void)? = nil)
// allows multiple insert/delete/reload/move calls to be animated simultaneously. Nestable.
```

<!-- > -->

When doing this operations we need to be careful with the order of handling the datasource and triggering the animations. <br><br>
The order of *collection view updates* **won't** matter.<br>
The order of the *updates* in the datasource **does** matter<br>

Example: Delete 0 -> Insert 1 vs Insert 1 -> Delete 0

<!-- > -->

### Guidelines for updates
- Decompose Move into Delete and Insert updates
- Combine all Delete and Insert updates
- Process Delete updates first, in descending order
- Process Insert updates last, in ascending order

<!-- > -->

## In Class Activity

The sample project has a nav bar button with the title "update".

When we tap the "Example" option, these are the things that should happen:

- Update the value of the item at position 3
- Move the item at position 3 to position 0

<!-- > -->

## reloadData

- No updates required
- Resync data source to collection view
- Not animated
- The brute force that works

<!-- > -->

### Challenge - more updates
You will be completing the rest of the options in the "Update" menu.
Take into consideration the guidelines to avoid crashing the app.

<!-- > -->

## Lab + After Class

Extend the subscription box app to display a gallery of categories available in the box.

For example:

- Pet box: Grooming, Toys, Treats, Clothing
- Food box: Vegetables, Dairy, Meat, Cereal, Fruits
- Clothing box: Tops, Bottoms, Shoes, Outerwear

Look for the example VC in [the design online](https://zpl.io/bejlAMq). It's the "New box" screen, where users select/deselect what items they would like to receive.

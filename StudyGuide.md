# Study Guide for MOB 1.2 Final Assessment<br>

*Overview:* Your final exam will focus on the learning outcomes for this course.  Review each outcome thoroughly and ask questions if you are unclear about the outcome or your level of understanding.

*Final Exam Format:* It will consist of two parts: one will be answered in your computer using an Xcode project, and the second one, will be written on paper. The exam will take 2 hours to complete.  If you have a disability that requires any accommodation for the final exam, please reach out to Jen or Anne to make sure this is documented according to the Make School Accommodations Policy and clarify with your instructor what accommodations will be made. 

Build an app using UIKit components including: UIViews, UIViewControllers, UITableViews, UICollectionViews and custom classes.
Apply AutoLayout & Size Classes to achieve a good distribution of elements in different screen sizes and orientations.
Implement MVC and understand the separation of concerns for each component.
Pass information between view controllers using segues and also using the manual approach.


**Outcome 1:Build an app using UIKit components including: UIViews, UIViewControllers, UITableViews, UICollectionViews and custom classes.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- All of the course tutorials used UIKit for their graphical components either using storyboards or having them programmatically.
- Class No. 4 covered custom views.
- Class No. 6 covered UITableViews.
- Class No. 7 & 8 covered UICollectionViews
- Habitual tutorial covered custom cells.
- In-class project covered all these topics.

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Create UITableViews and UICollectionViews implementing datasource and delegate methods.
- Instantiate UIViewControllers programmatically.
- Create and handle .xib files.
- Create a custom cell for UITableViews and UICollectionViews.


**Outcome 2: Apply AutoLayout & Size Classes to achieve a good distribution of elements in different screen sizes and orientations.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Class No. 1 & 2 covered AutoLayout.
- Class No. 3 covered constraints programmatically.
- In-Class project used AutoLayout.

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Knowing when to manipulate CHP & CCRP.
- Displaying elements in a UIStackView.
- Applying Size Classes to a UIViewController.
- Setting constraints programmatically.

**Outcome 3: Implement MVC and understand the separation of concerns for each component.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Class No. 5  covered MVC basics.
- Habitual tutorial project uses MVC.
- In-Class project covered was structured using MVC.

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Create models.
- Create custom views such as cells.
- Know how to reference the model and the views from the controller.
- Know what each component is responsible for.

**Outcome 4: Pass information between view controllers & handling navigation.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Class No. 5 covered navigation & passing information.
- Class No. 10 covered tab bar controller

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Navigating programmatically, using different animations (present, push, dismiss, pop).

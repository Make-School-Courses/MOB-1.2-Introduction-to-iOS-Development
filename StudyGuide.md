# Study Guide for MOB 1.2 Final Assessment<br>

*Overview:* Your final exam will focus on the learning outcomes for this course.  Review each outcome thoroughly and ask questions if you are unclear about the outcome or your level of understanding.

*Final Exam Format:* Your final exam will be on December 11.  It will consist of two parts: the main one will be answered in your computer using an Xcode project, and the second one, and much shorter, will be written on paper. The exam will take 2 hours to complete.  If you have a disability that requires any accommodation for the final exam, please reach out to Jen or Anne to make sure this is documented according to the Make School Accommodations Policy and clarify with your instructor what accommodations will be made. 

**Outcome 1: Build an app using UIKit basic components including: UIViews, UIViewControllers, UITableViews, UICollectionViews and custom cells.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- All of the course tutorials used UIKit for their graphical components either using storyboards or having them programmatically.
- Class No. 1 covered basic UIKit components (identification and naming).
- Class No. 5 covered how to manipulate UI elements in code.
- Class No. 6 covered UITableViews.
- Class No. 9 covered UICollectionViews
- Habitual tutorial and the project Mood Tracker covered custom cells.

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Create UITableViews and UICollectionViews implementing datasource and delegate methods.
- Instantiate UIViewControllers two ways: programmatically and referencing them from the storyboard.
- Create and handle .xib files.
- Create a custom cell for UITableViews and UICollectionViews.
- Create IBOutlets and IBActions for elements in the storyboard.

**Outcome 2: Apply AutoLayout & Size Classes to achieve a good distribution of elements in different screen sizes and orientations.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Class No. 2 covered AutoLayout.
- Class No. 4 covered UIStackView, CHP & CCRP.
- Class No. 5 covered Size Classes.
- You applied size classes to the Magic 8 ball tutorial.

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Knowing when to manipulate CHP & CCRP.
- Displaying elements in a UIStackView.
- Applying Size Classes to a UIViewController.
- Setting constraints programmatically with any approach.
- Setting how to set constraints in the storyboard.

**Outcome 3: Implement MVC in a basic iOS app, understanding the separation of concerns for each component.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Class No. 3  covered MVC basics.
- Habitual tutorial and Mood Tracker project use MVC.
- The map project for class used a Model for the mapâ€™s annotations.

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Create models.
- Create custom views such as cells.
- Know how to reference the model and the views from the controller.
- Know what each component is responsible for.

**Outcome 4: Pass information between view controllers using segues and also using the manual approach.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Class No. 7 covered Segues.
- Class No. 8 covered manual navigation.

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Creating segues to navigate between view controllers and sending information.
- Creating unwind segues to pass back information.
- Navigating programmatically, using different animations (present, push, dismiss, pop).

**Outcome 4: Apply different techniques to find and solve bugs within Xcode & Best Practices.**

Ways we learned about this in the course
- Class No. 10 covered debugging.
- Class on SOLID principles

Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
- Identify different methods to debug apps.
- Knowing causes of errors & crashes.
- Being able to explain at a basic level what each SOLID principle tries to solve.
